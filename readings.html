<h1>Homework #1: Web Basics</h1>
<p>Although coding doesn’t come off as media or media related, it does build a foundation for media to get out on the internet. Most websites we have today are related to media, whether it be YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Requires and relies on some aspect of code or programming.  Beyond writing code, it makes it much easier for news stations, newspapers, content creators, and many more media creators / artists to convey their content, their message, and their artistic ideas to the world. Coding gives us as artists, media producers, or consumers a chance to fully understand and utilize platforms, code written by others a chance to make something. Also reading the article and watching the video for a more in-depth explanation of the code language, HTML. I’ve taken to understanding fundamental ideas and terminology that is very helpful when using it to create a website. That will mainly be showcasing my portfolio whilst I’m at Hunter. I had signed up for GitHub to make my site, but also to practice coding so certain prompts wouldn’t become an issue, also messing around with things like the tables and other things as well. I’ve also signed up for Code Academy, to also help me visual as the article demonstrates certain key terminology but also playing with other terms that wasn’t assigned as well. Learning those to make my website look neater or come off in a certain way.</p>
