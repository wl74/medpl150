<p>Image shown on left is the original, Image shown on the right is the cropped verison. </p>

<p>I chose this image because of the foreground, but also because the lines and the shadows it created. Though it didn't follow the traditional rules of thirds, you can see the difference in lighting which is another thing that I focused on this photo when I was editing. With the railing in the photo also caught my eye as well to seeing that. </p>
