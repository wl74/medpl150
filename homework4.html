  <h1>Photomontage</h1>

  <p>With this image in particular, I wanted to capture the focus of a personal but also a social issue that can be applicable to many people on a personal issue as well. As for me personally, I constantly feel like time is moving way too fast. That I want to be stuck in a memory. The original photo was with me and my friends, the birds were another of my image (used in the second image as well), but some images that weren't mine, was the overlay of sand, the ice that masked the people in the photo, and the eye. Each of them symbolizing something related with nostaglia or memory. Sand as in reference to time and how limited it is, the Eye looking back at the memories with the ice representing how we're stuck in time. With the birds being freedom, something that could be achieved to replicate memories like those everyday if reality never existed. Each image was to display a personal and selfish thing that we all have, to live in the past and feel dragged into it. </p> <br />

  <p>This image was one that came to mind, when I heard the words politcal and social, I thought of the First Amendment and Freedom in general. The background image is something I had taken, the jelly fish and microphone, with the grainy like overlay were images I found. I wanted to talk about freedom and how limited but also extreme we take our ideas and thoughts for freedom. The animals typically represent this idea of freedom, with their movements like flying and flowing freely. The microphone which is representative of speech and speaking. But the position of the animals are also ironic, like the jelly fish going down instead of up, like life and death. The birds not also referencing freedom but also the idea of death as well, people who fought for their freedom. Each idea of the this image was something that I was excitied to make, despite the simplicity of it, I think it can tell my message, though it does need more to express the idea.  </p> <br />

  <p>Both of these screenshots provided relate to the images shown above, learning about layers and how to utilize the layers individually. Each layer requiring a mask of somesort, using the blur tool, the lasso tool, and blending tools to create the image that I had visualize.</p>
